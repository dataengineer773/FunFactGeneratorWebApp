In this project, we will discuss how to create a Fun Fact Generator Web App in Python using the PyWebio module. Essentially, it will create interesting facts at random and display them on the web interface. 
This script will retrieve data from uselessfacts.jsph.pl with the help of GET method, and we will use the 
requests and the JSON module to acquire and load the data respectively. After the data has been loaded, 
just pass the text within the dictionary so that we can only get the jokes. For creating a simple and interactive interface on the web, we will use the PyWebIO module.
PyWebIO contains functions for getting user input and output on the browser, turning the browser into a "rich text terminal", and can be used to build simple web applications or browser-based GUI applications.
With this module, anyone can produce a web application without any prior knowledge or overhead of HTML and JS...
